== Changelog ==

= 0.1 =
* Initial release

= 0.2 =
* Small fixes

= 0.3 =
* Added caching of the rss to the WordPress database to make the widget faster and less dependant of copygr.am

= 0.31 =
* Small css fix

= 0.4 =
* Added the possibility to bypass the Copygram site and instead link directly to the large image. Works like magic with image viewers like fancybox.
* Fixed minor typo

= 0.5 =
* Fixing double slashes in the rss. When saving your widget the cache is cleared so you don't have to wait! :)  An update for correct links is coming soon, the data coming from Copygr.am is wrong so there is not much I can do. Use Link to image for now.

= 0.6 =
Added the possibility to link to Instagram instead of Copygram
